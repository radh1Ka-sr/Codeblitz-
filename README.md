**Event Description**

**Innovative Web Solutions for Civil Engineering Challenges**

The field of civil engineering confronts distinct challenges that call for intelligent and innovative solutions to elevate efficiency, sustainability, and safety in construction projects. As the industry evolves, there is an increasing demand for advanced technologies and innovative approaches.

The aim of this event is to develop a cutting-edge web application designed to address a specific challenge within civil engineering. Participants are challenged to identify a particular problem and devise smart solutions that not only resolve traditional issues but also propel the construction industry towards a more advanced and efficient future.

For detailed guidance and insights into the challenges, participants are encouraged to review the Problem Statement provided [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tyhndba0XfFNV4zqMcrF1ek2t6bs3xBa?usp=drive_link).

**Submission Deadline**
Please note that all submissions must be finalized and submitted by 5:00 PM on April 6th.

**Additional Guidelines**

- Participants are encouraged to utilize any framework of their choice for the development of the web application and user interface. Options may include React, Angular, Vue.js, or any other preferred framework.
- Implement a backend server using frameworks like Node.js, Django, Flask, etc. Handle HTTP requests and responses effectively.
- Set up a database to store and retrieve data for your website .Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as needed.  
- Participants have the freedom to select any database that best suits their project requirements, whether it be MongoDB, Firebase, or another database solution.
- We emphasize the importance of writing clean, well-organized, and well-documented code. This approach will facilitate a more efficient and comprehensive review process, allowing for a more accurate assessment of your skills and contributions.
